## Team Management
Report here, by the end of the assignment, how the team has managed the project, e.g.: used version control, organised meetings, divided work, used labels, milestones, issues, etc. etc.

## Test Plan
**You should add rows and even columns, and indeed more tables, freely as you think will improve the report.**
